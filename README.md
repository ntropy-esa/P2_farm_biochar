# P2a_farm_biochar

A repo containing the code for research on on-farm biochar production potential estimates, variability and life cycle impacts.

### Contents
- /farm_interview: material and methods for interviews and primary data collected from the case studies
- /farm_demand: calculates farm heating demand and saves vector at selected aggregation level
- /farm_supply: defines the units available on the farm to supply heat/electricity
- /farm_ficus: solves supply=demand while minimising a given function (climate impact); based on ficus.py, economic optimisation for industrial sites
- /farm_bw2: calculates several evaluation indicators, based on output of farm_ficus, and parse the output to a bw2-compatible format

- howTo_farm_biochar.jnb: jupyter notebook explaining 
- cs1_Lindeborgs.jnb: notebook for case 1, Lindeborgs
- cs2_Frakentorp.jnb: notebook for case 2, Fr√§kentorp

Each repo has a howTo_farm_** and a dev_farm_** notebooks.
